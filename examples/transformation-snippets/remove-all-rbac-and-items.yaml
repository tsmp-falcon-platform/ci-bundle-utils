# In addition to the normal operationalize.yaml, this transformation uses patches to remove:
# - the roles and groups from rbac.yaml
# - the items from the items.yaml file
#
# if no items are left in the items.yaml file, the file itself is removed
# if no roles/groups are left in the rbac.yaml file, the file itself is removed

patches:
  items.yaml:
  - op: remove
    path: /items
  rbac.yaml:
  - op: remove
    path: /roles
  - op: remove
    path: /groups
